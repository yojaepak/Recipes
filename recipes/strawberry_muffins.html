    <h1>Strawberry Muffins</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        These strawberry muffins are a great way to use up your spring and summer
         strawberries. They are a nice change from the usual blueberry muffins and 
         just as delicious. The secret is adding lots of berries to the batter, which 
         gives the muffins an intense strawberry flavor, along with a touch of almond 
         extract to complement the fruit.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups all purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>¾ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 stick or ½ cup unsalted butter, softened</li>
        <li>1 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1½ teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon almond extract</li>
        <li>½ cup milk</li>
        <li>2¼ cups diced strawberries</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons turbinado sugar</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375°F. Line a 12-cup muffin tin with paper liners; spray the liners and the pan with non-stick cooking spray.</li>
        <li>In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder and salt.</li>
        <li>In the bowl of an electric mixer, beat the butter and granulated sugar for about 2 minutes. Add the eggs one at a time, scraping down the sides of the bowl and beating well after each addition. Beat in the vanilla extract and almond extract. (The batter may look a little grainy -- that's okay).</li>
        <li>With the mixer on low, add the flour mixture in three separate additions, alternating with the milk and ending with the flour.</li>
        <li>Toss the strawberries with 2 teaspoons of flour (this will keep them from sinking to the bottom). Set ½ cup of the berries aside. Add the remaining berries to the batter and fold with a spatula until evenly distributed. Do not overmix.</li>
        <li>Scoop the batter into the prepared muffin tin (an ice-cream scoop with a wire scraper works well here); they will be very full. Scatter the reserved berries evenly over the muffins, then sprinkle the turbinado sugar over the center of each muffin (keeping the sugar away from the edges will prevent sticking).</li>
        <li>Bake for about 30 minutes, until lightly golden and a cake tester comes out clean. Run a sharp knife around the top edge of each muffin to free it from the pan if necessary (the edges can stick), then let the muffins cool in the pan for about 25 minutes. Transfer the muffins to a rack to cool completely.</li>
    </ol>
